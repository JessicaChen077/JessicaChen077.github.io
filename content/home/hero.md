We have been dedicated to developing statistical methods to make sense of
genetic and omics data from large cohorts, with the goal of better diagnosing,
treating, and preventing complex diseases.

Our research interests focus primarily on **genomic variation and population
health**, integrating omics data to understand molecular mechanisms underpinning
complex traits and diseases, genomic risk prediction, **cancer genomics**, and
**bioinformatics software development**.
